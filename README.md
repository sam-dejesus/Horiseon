# Horiseon
## Description
The purpose of this repository and code is to refactor the original code so that it is up to date with accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

This was accomplished by adding the "alt" attribute to all images, adding semantic HTML and reducing the use of Div tags, cleaning up some of the CSS by reducing the number of repetitive declarations and class attributes. added a concise, descriptive title and, changed some heading tags so they fall in sequential order.
